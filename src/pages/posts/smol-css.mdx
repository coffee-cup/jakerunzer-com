# smol.css

Every time I interact with the default browser styles I am surprised just how ugly they are. I then start applying the same basic styles to de-uglify the page and _modernizing_ things like the font family, spacing, and type scale.

To speed up this process I've created `smol.css`. A drop in CSS file that you can add to any site to make it look a bit less like [the very first web page](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). It is intended to improve the look, feel, and readability of text focus sites.

You can find an example of what the CSS files does at [smol.jakerunzer.com](https://smol.jakerunzer.com). It is also available [on GitHub](https://github.com/coffee-cup/smol.css). Feel free to fork, edit, modify however you like.

A plan on extending this over time and maybe one day it will resemble an actual CSS framework. For now, it is just a simple replacement for browser styles.
