description: Rebuilding my personal site.
---

Wow. It's been a long time since I've updated this site. Things in my life have
been very busy over the last few years. I've basically been heads down building
and giving [Railway](https://railway.app) everything I have. Non-Railway time
has been dedicated to my family and friends. 

The update of this site does not change that, but lately I've been feeling the
_itch to build_. Not build anything in particular, but build for the sake of
building. I've been wanting to get back to my roots and make something for
myself. 

In my early years of programming I would make things all the time. Just random
projects that didn't really have a purpose or a goal. I learned a ton doing
that. After graduating that slowed down a bit, and then after joining Railway,
it basically stopped. There always seems to be an exuse. Maybe I'll have family
visiting for a week so want to spend time with them after work. And then when I
finally do get some free time, my execuse is that I should be resting or doing
something out and about in the city (Montreal really is great).

Well, I'm tired of the excuses and I'm going to make time to build for myself.
It starts with the creation of this new site. A place where I can share about
what I'm working on in the simplest way possible.

## The stack

My last personal site was _supposed_ to be simple. However, it ended up being a
pain to update and maintain. It was a NextJS site that parsed my local Obsidian
vault and published files with specific frontmatter. I thought it was a good
idea at the time, but I just never updated it because it was overly complex and
I didn't want to deal with it.

The new site is simple af. It is a static site built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and is styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). Nothing fancy.
Does this mean I will update it more frequently? Not sure, but hopefully. I already have a few post ideas.

## Projects

I want to use projects to learn about things that I am interested in. A list I will be working through in no particular order is
- Programming language in Rust
- TUIs in Rust
- Bevy roguelike game
- Wasm4 game with Zig
- Raytracer in one weekend
- Desktop app midi sequencer

There will definitely be more that I will explore, but this is a start. Hopefully I can revisit this post in a year and update the list with links to projects. I guess we will see.
