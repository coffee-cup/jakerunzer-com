I often forget all the options for cursors in CSS and testing each one in
Chrome is tedious and time consuming. That is why I made Cursors. Available at
[cursors.jakerunzer.com](https://cursors.jakerunzer.com). A small
website that shows you all examples of CSS cursors and allows you to
copy them to clipboard.

Source is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/coffee-cup/cursors).

This also the first thing I've built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
It has been a great experience so far and I expect I will use Svelte a lot
more in the future for tiny sites like this.
