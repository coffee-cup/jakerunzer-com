description: A custom URL shortener built with Rust, Rocket, and Svelte.
---

I've wanted a custom URL shortener on jakrunzer.com for some time now. Recently
I went and built a small service that does just that!

Check it out at [cheryl.fun](https://cheryl.fun/)


The source code is available at
[github.com/coffee-cup/shortener](https://github.com/coffee-cup/shortener).

## The Stack

When starting this project, I really wanted to use Rust. I love the language but
never end up using it for real projects. Not anymore!

I went with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) for the webserver. I've heard good
things and from browsing the docs I liked how it handled state management and
context throughout different routes.

For the actually shortener itself, I based my implementation off [this blog
post](https://endler.dev/2017/rust-url-shortener/) but extended it to store the
mapping between short code and URL in Redis. The actual implementation is fairly
simple.

```rust
impl Cache for RedisRepository {
    fn store(&mut self, url: &str) -> String {
        let keys: Vec<String> = self.con.keys("*").unwrap();
        let count = keys.len() as u64;
        let hashed = self.generator.encode(&[count]);

        let _: () = self.con.set(hashed.clone(), url).unwrap();

        hashed
    }

    fn lookup(&mut self, id: &str) -> Option<String> {
        let url: Option<String> = match self.con.get(id) {
            Ok(val) => Some(val),
            Err(_e) => None,
        };

        url
    }
}
```
## Frontend

Normally my goto for frontend is Nextjs. But lately I've been really enjoying
using Svelte, especially for smaller projects like this.

I use Rocket static files to serve the public directory on the `/` route and
then use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle the Svelte into something
deployable on the web. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) is used to
quickly style the site.
