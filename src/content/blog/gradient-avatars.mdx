Do you ever need a placeholder profile image for someone? Perhaps for new users
who haven't uploaded an image yet.

Well, I often do. Which is why I've built [Gradient
Avatars](https://avatars.jakerunzer.com), a tool that will give you a
deterministic circular SVG image with a gradient based on some text.

For example, the text "hello" outputs:

![Gradient Avatar With Text Hello](https://avatars.jakerunzer.com/hello)

"asdf" creates the image:

![Gradient Avatar With Text Hello](https://avatars.jakerunzer.com/asdf)

The source url for these images is `avatars.jakerunzer.com/{text}`, where text
is something unique.
